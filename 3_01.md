Network Layer

LAN (local area network) 
- node can communicate with each other via physcial MAC addresses
- each MAC address is unique and is not sorted in any systematic way
-> not ideal to communicate across distances

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

Network Layer

IP address
- 32-bit (4-byte) long numbers made up of 4 octets
e.g. 172.16.254.1 (Dotted decimal Notation)
0-255

- IP adresses belong to networks, not the devices attached to those networks

On many modern networks, we can connect a new device and an IP address will be assigned to it automatically
-> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
-> Dynamic IP address

i.e. in most cases, static IP addresses are reserved for servers and network devices, while dynamic IP addresses are reserved for clients

a packet -> IP datagram = a highly structured series of fields that are strictly defined

the first 2 primary sections of an IP datagram are
- header
- payload

1. 4 bits : version of internet protocol is being used
2. 4 bits : header length (almost always 20 bytes in length when dealing with IPv4 -> minimum length of an IP header)
3. 8 bits: service type field which specifies details about quality of service, or QoS(we can decide with IP address weights more), technolgies
4. 16 bits: total length (of the IP datagram it's attached to)
5. 16 bits: identication field (used to group messages together)

Max size of a single datagram is the largest number you can represent with 16 bits: 65535

if the total amount of data that needs to be sent is larger than what can fit in a single datagram, the IP layer needs to split this data up into many individual packets

flag field : indicaet if a datagram is allowed to be fragmented or to indicate that the datagram has already been fragmented

fragmentation : the process of taking a single IP datagram and splitting it up into several smaller datagrams

TTL: 8 bit field that indicates how many router hops a datagram can traverse before it's thrown away (Time to Live field)
-> everytime a datagram reaches a new router, that router decerements the TTL field by one
-> once reaches 0, it does not forward the datagram any further
- standard for a TTL field value is 64

Protocol field: anther 8-bit field that contains data about what transport layer protocol(TCP or UCP) is being used

header checksum: a checksum of the contents of the entire IP datagram header

Source IP addresses: 32-bit 

Destination IP addresses: 32-bit 

IP options : OPTIONAL and is used to set special chars for datagrams primarily used for testing purpose

IP padding : a series of 0s used to ensure the header is the correct total size

IP datagram (Ethernet header and footer) (Data-Link)

IP addresses = network ID (1) + host ID (rest)

Address class system
- a way of defining how the global IP address space is split up
-> class A
 - the first octet is used for network ID, last three are for host ID
-> class B
 - the two octet is used for network ID, second two are for host ID
-> class C
 - the three octet is used for network ID, last one are for host ID

Class  | Ranger | Max Hosts
A			0-126		16 Million
B 			128-191	64000
C			192-223	254

first bit of an IP is 0 -> class A network
first bit are one, zero -> B
first bit are one, one  -> C

each octet of an IP address (8-bit) : each octet takes value b/t 0-255
class D starts with 1110 -> multicasting -> how a single IP datagram can be sent to an entire network at once
class E -> unassigned and only used for testing

ARP
- how MAC address are used at the Data-Link Layer
- how IP addresses are used at the Network Layer
-> ARP connects the two tgt
= a protocol used to discover the hardware address of a node with a certain IP address

once an IP datagram has been fully formed, it needs to be encapsulated inside a Ethernet frame
-> needs a destination MAC address to complete the Ethernet frame header

ARP table
- a list of IP addresses and the MAC addresses associated with them
e.g. FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
- generally expire after a short amount of time to ensure changes in the network are accounted for 

Subnetting
- the process of taking a large network and splitting it up into many individual and smaller subnetworks, or subnets

Subnet Masks
- subnet ID -> some bits comprise the host ID are used for the subnet ID
- core router only cares network ID
- host ID is used by the last router 
= 32-bit numbers that are normally written out as 4 octets in decimal

Subnet mask
- the part of number with all 1s tells us what we can ignore when computing a host ID -> subnet ID (the rest are host ID)
- the size of a subnet is entirely defined by its subnet mask
- a subnet can only contain 2 less than the total number of host IDs available
=> only 1-254 are available for assignment to a host
- use AND operators to determine if an IP address exists on the same network
first octet: 1111 1111
last octet: 0000 0000

e.g. 255.255.255.224
  11111111 11111111 11111111 11100000 -> 27=1s, 5=0s
  we have 5 bits of host ID space or a total of 32 addresses
  
  deal with e.g. 9.100.100.100
  -> since there are 27-1s above, we use a notation /27.
  ===> the entire IP and subnet mask can be written now as 
  9.100.100.100/27
  
traditional network ID
8 bit (A)
16 bit (B)
24 bit (C)
= 254 classing networks in existence

CIDR (Classes Inter-Domain Routing)
- more flexible approach to describe blocks of IP addresses
- expands the concept of subnetting by using subnet masks to demarcate networks

Demarcate
- to set sth off

Demarcation point
- to describe where one network or system ends and another one begins

In the previously model, we rely on a network ID, subnet ID, host ID to deliver an IP datagram to the correct location
-> with CIDR, the network ID and subnet IP are combined into one

/ => CIDR notation -> abandons the concepts of address classes entirely
==> allowing an address to be defined by only two individual IDs
=> gets additional host IDs out of this practice

Basic Routing Concepts

Router
- a network device that forwards traffic depending on the destination address of that traffic
- >= 2 network interfaces

Basic Routing:
1. receive data packet
2. router examines destination IP
3. router looks up IP destination network in routing table
4. forwards traffic to destination

Routing table
- 4 columns = destination network
- Next hop: the IP address of the next router that receive data intended for the destination networking question or this could just state the network is directly connected
- total hops: shortest path the finish the network cycle
- interface

Routing protocols: interior gateway protocols (Link state + distance-vector) + exterior gateway protocols

Interior gateway protocols 
- used by routers to share info within a single autonomous system

Autonomous system
- a collection of networks that all fall under the control of a single network operator

Distance-vector protocol
- older standard
- just takes its routing table and checks how far away these networks are in terms of hops
- the router sends this list to every neighboring router which is bascially every router directly connected to it
 
List is known as a vector in Computer Science
 
Exterior gateway protocols
- used to communicate data b/t routers representing the edges of an autonomous system

IANA (Internet Assigned Nums of Authority)
- an NGO helps managing things like IP address allocation

Along with managing IP address allocation , the IANA is also responsible for ASN
(Autonomous System Num) allocation

ASN
- nums assigned to individual autonomous systems

Non-Routable Address Space
- ranges of IPs set aside for use by anyone that cannot be routed to
- allows for nodes on such a network to communicate with each other but no gateway router will attempt to forward traffic to this type of network

RFC 1918 = Request for comment -> 3 types of IP addresses that will never be routed anywher by co-routers -> they belong to no one and anyone can use them
1. 10.0.0.0/8
2. 172.16.0.0/12
3. 192.168.0.0/16


NAT (Network Address Translation)
- allows computer on non-routable address space to communicate with other devices on Internet

Transport Layer 
- allow traffic to be directed to spec network apps
-> multiplexing + demultiplexing traffic (via PORTS) -> ensure data integrity via error checking and data verification

Multiplexing in the transport layer means that nodes on the network have the ability to direct traffic toward many different receiving services

processes ->* multiplexer -> IP

Demulyiplexing is the same concept, just at the receiving end

IP -> Demultiplexer -> processes*

PORT 
- a 16-bit number that is used to direct traffic to spec services running on a networked computer
e.g. traditional port for HTTP or unencrypted web traffic is port 80 (IP 10.1.1.100)
- normally denoted with a colon afte the IP address
=> IP:PORT = socket address/number

FTP
- older method used for transfering files from one to another
- listens on port 21

Dissection a TCP segment
- an IP datagram encapsulates a TCP segment (an Ethernet frame has a payload section)
- TCP also has a payload section (i.e. a TCP segment)
- sequence number = a 32-bit number that is used for keep track of where in a sequence of TCP segments this one is expected to be
- acknowledgement number = the number of the next expected segment
- data offset field = a 4-bit number that communicates how long the TCP header for this segment is
- control flags = a 6-bit number
- TCP window = specifies the range of sequence numbers that might be send before an acknowledgement is required
- checksum = 16-bit checksum fields similar at the one at IP and ethernet level
- urgent pointer field = used in conjunction with one of the TCP control flags to point out particular segments that might be more important than others -> never finds it in modern networking
- options (0 or 16 if any) = sometimes used for more complicated flow control protocols
- padding: a sequence of 0s to ensure the data payload section begins at the expected location

TCP Control Flags (6)
1. URG(urgent) = 1 as urgent and that urgent pointer field has more data about this
2. ACK (acknowledged) = 1 as the acknowledge number field should be examined
3. PSH (Push) = the transmitting device wants the receiving device to push currently-buffered data to the application on the receiving end asap
4. RST (Reset) = one of the sides in the TCP connection hasn't been able to properly recover from a series of missing or malformed segments
5. SYN (synchronize) = used when first establishing a TCP connection and makes sure the receiving end knows to examine the sequence number field
6. FIN (Finish) = 1 means the transmitting computer doesn't has any more data to send and the connection can be closed 

A: transmitting computer
B: receiving computer
Process: 
1. A sends a TCP segment to B with this SYN flag set (-> establish a connection and look at A's sequence num field)
2. B responds with a TCP segment to A with SYN and ACK
3. A responds with ACK
---> three-way handshake (--> TCP connection is established)

four-way handshake
- when one of the connected devices is about to end the session
- the computer ready to end session sends FIN
- the received computer sends ACK
- that computer also sends FIN
- the another computer responds with an ACK

Handshake 
- a way for 2 devices to ensure that they are speaking the same protocol and will be able to understand each other

TCP segment
= a TCP header (another payload area for where the application layer places its data) +  a data section

TCP header
- source port (16) = a high-numbered port chosen from a special section of ports know n as ephemeral ports
- destination port (16) = the port of the service the traffic is intended for

TCP socket
- the instantiation of an end-point in a potential TCP connection
- requires actual programs to instantiate them v.s. PORT which is more virtual

-> we can send traffic to any PORT but we only get response if a program has opened a socket on that PORT

LISTEN
- a TCP socket is ready and listening for incoming connections
- on server-side only

SYN_SENT
- a synchronization request has been sent, but the connection hasn't been established yet
- client-side only

SYN_RECEIVED
- a socket previously in a LISTEN state has received a synchronization request an sent a SYN/ACK back
- server-side only

ESTABLISHED
- the TCP connecftion is in working order and both sides are free to send each other data
- both server and client sides

FIN_WAIT
- a FIN has been sent, but the corresponding ACK from the other end hasn't been received yet
- both server and client sides

CLOSE_WAIT
- both server and client sides
- the connection has been closed at the TCP layer
- but that application that opened the socket hasn't released its hold on the socket yet

CLOSED
- both server and client sides
- the connection has been fully terminated and that no further communication is possible

Instantiation
- the actual implementation of sth defined elsewhere

Connection-Oriented Protocols
-> TCP
- establishes a connection
- uses this to ensure that all data has been properly transmitted
- a connection at the transport layer implies that every segment of data sent is ACK

Connectionless protocols
-> UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- doesn't rely on connections
- doesn't support ACK
- just set a destination PORT + send the packet
e.g. streaming video

Port 0 isn’t in use for network traffic

Ports 1-1023 are referred to as system ports, or sometimes as “well-known ports.” 

Ports 1024-49151 are known as registered ports.

Finally, we have ports 49152-65535. These are known as private or ephemeral ports.

Firewall
- a device that blocks traffic that meets certain criteria
- operate at transport layer (+ host level as well)
- a program that can run anywhere
- sometimes independent network devices

Application Layer
- allow these apps to communicate in a way they understand

data-link layer-> common protocol = ethernet
network layer-> common protocol = IP
transport layer-> common protocol= TCP & UCP
application layer-> common protocol = HTTP

web servers
- Microsoft IIS
- Apache
- nginx

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection model)
- important to understand with our five-layer model -> most rigorously defined
- 7 layers
- Application >Presentation** > Session**> Transport> Network> Data Link

Session Layer
- facilitating the communciation b/t actual applications and the transport layer
- takes application layer data and hands it off to the presentation layer

Presentation Layer
- responsible for making sure that the unencapsulated application layer data is able to be understood by the application in question

Application + Presentation + Session = Application Layer (as no encapsulation going on)
