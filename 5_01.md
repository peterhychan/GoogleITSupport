"Confidentiality" signifies that data is only viewable by those authorized to view it; 
e.g. password protection

"Integrity" denotes that data won't be manipulated or corrupted;
-> keeping data accurate and untampered with

"Availability" means that services remain reachable and available.

--> CIA triad = a guiding model for designing info security policies

Risk 
- the possibility of suffering a loss in the event of an attack on the system
e.g. screen lock on smartphone

Vulnerability
- a flaw in the system that could be exploited to comprpmise the system
-> holes that you may or may not be aware of
e.g. 0-day vulnerability = the amount of time the software vendor has had to react to and to fix the vulnerability

Exploit
- software that is used to take advantage of a security bug or vulnerability
--> Attackers will write up exploits for vulnerabilities they find in software to cause harm to the system.

Threat
- the possibility of DANGER that could exploit a vulnerability

Hacker
- someone who attempts to break into or exploit a system 
--> black hackers (-) , white hackers (+)

Malware 
-  type of malicious software that can be used to obtain your sensitive information or delete or modify files

->Viruses are the best known type of malware, and they work the same way that viruses in your body work
->Worms can live on their own and spread through channels like the network
->Adware is just software that displays advertisements and collects data.
->Trojans may get installed without your consent and may do other malicious things than just display advertisements.
->Keylogger is a common type of spyware that's used to record every keystroke you make. 
->Ransomware is a type of attack that holds your data or system hostage until you pay some sort of ransom.
->Bots can utilize someone else's machine to perform a task that is centrally controlled by the attacker
-> Botnet is a collection of BOTS e.g. collecting Bitcoins
-> A backdoor is a way to get into a system if the other methods to get in a system aren't allowed, it's a secret entryway for attackers.
-> Rootkit means a collection of software or tools that an admin would use.

DNA cache poisoning attack
- DNS works by getting information about IP addresses and names to make it easier for you to find a website
- attack works by tricking a DNS server into accepting a fake DNS record that will point you to a compromised DNS server. 
- It then feeds you fake DNS addresses when you try to access legitimate websites.
- DNS Cache Poisoning can spread to other networks too. If other DNS servers are getting their DNS information from a compromised server, they'll serve those bad DNS entries to other hosts.

Man-in-the-middle attack
- is an attack that places the attacker in the middle of two hosts that think they're communicating directly with each other
- the attack will monitor the information going to and from these hosts, and potentially modify it in transit
e.g. session hijacking (they could steal that token and impersonate you on the website), 
e.g. cookie hijacking
e.g. rogue access point attack => an access point that is installed on the network without the network administrator's knowledge.
e.g. evil twin => the identical network is our networks evil twin and is controlled by our attacker. Once we connect to it, they will be able to monitor our traffic

A Denial-of-Service, or DoS attack
- is an attack that tries to prevent access to a service for legitimate users by overwhelming the network or server. 
e.g. The Ping of Death or POD => sending a malformed ping to a computer. The ping would be larger in size than what the internet protocol was made to handle. So it results in a buffer overflow. This can cause the system to crash and potentially allow the execution of malicious code. 
e.g. a ping flood => which sends tons of ping packets to a system. More specifically, it sends ICMP echo requests, since a ping expects an equal number of ICMP echo replies. If a computer can't keep up with this, then it's prone to being overwhelmed and taken down.
e.g. a SYN flood => the server is being bombarded with the SYN packets. The server is sending back SYN-ACK packets but the attacker is not sending ack messages. This means that the connection stays open and is taking up the server's resources. Other users will be unable to connect to the server which is a big problem. 

injection attacks
x -> Injection attacks can be mitigated with good software development principles, like validating input and sanitizing data

Cross-site scripting, or XSS attacks,
- are a type of injection attack where the attacker can insert malicious code and TARGET THE USER of the service.
- achieve a session hijacking

a SQL injection attack 
- targets the entire website if the website is using a SQL database. Attackers can potentially run SQL commands that allow them to delete website data, copy it, and run other malicious commands

Social engineering
- relies heavily on interactions with humans instead of computers
- attackers use deceptive techniques to gain access to personal information
e.g. a phishing attack
e.g. email spoofing ->  when you receive an email with a misleading sender address
e.g. baiting -> through actual physical contact
e.g. tailgating -> can occur offline
