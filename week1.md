Algorithm

- a series of steps that solve specific problems

Binary System
- the communication that a computer uses 
- a base-2 numeral system
- 1s and 0s
-> 8 bits = a byte ==> 2^8 = 256 variations

Character encoding
- assigns our binary values to characters so that we can read them
e.g. ASCII standard -> we only need 127 values
e.g. UTF-8 standard -> can store a char in more than one byte -> replace ASCII standard now

Abstraction
- to take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use
e.g. 404  = page not found 

A computer can be cut into four main layers: 
- hardware
- operating system 
- software  
- users
