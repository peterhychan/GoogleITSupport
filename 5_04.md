Error-detection
- the ability for a protocol or program to determin that sth went wrong

Error-recovery
- the ability for a protocol or program to attempt to fix it

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- not very human-readable
- used to communicate to the source of problematic traffic
- used by router or remote host to communicate while transmittion has failed back to the origin of the transmission
= header with a few fields + a data section by host to figure out which of their transmissions generated the error
=> Type field (8 bit)- what type of message is being delivered
=> Code field (8 bit)- indicates a more specific reason for the message than just a type
=> 16-bit checksum
=> 32-bit rest of header (optional)
=> data paylaod from ICMP packet (entire IP header and first 8-byte of the data payload of the offending packet)

Ping 
- lets you send a specical type of ICMP message called Echo Request
- if the destination is up and running and able to communicate on the network, it will send back an ICMP Echo Reply messaege type

Traceroute
- a uility that lets you discover the path between two nodes, and gives you info about each hop along the way
-> via a clever manipulation technique of the TTL field at the IP level
TTL field is decremented by one by every router that forwards the packet
-> when reaches zero, it stops
-> Time Exceeded message is sent back to the originating host
- uses the TTL field by first setting it to 1 for the first packet, 2 for the second, and so on until it meets the destination
- for each hop, traceroute will send 3 identntial packets (Win)
- (Linux or MacOS), traceroute sends UDP packets to very high port numbers
==> tracert
- mtr on Linux/MacOS
- pathping on Windows

Check if things work on Transport layer
- netcat - Linux/MacOS -> nc <host> <port> -z(zero input/output) -v(verbose)
- Test-NetConnection -Windows -> Test-NetConnection <host> -port <PORT_NUM>

Name Resolution Tools
1. nslookup <host name> -> returns what server was used to perform the request and the resolution result
 => Default: A records
 ext. set debug
 
An ISP almost always gives you access to a recursive name server as part of the service it provides

Public DNS Servers
- Name servers specifically set up so that anyone can use them, for free
-> run by Level 3 communications
-> the IP addresses for Level 3s public DNS servers are 4.2.2.1 through 4.2.2.6

e.g. Google public name servers on the IPs 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4

Most public DNS servers are available globally through anycast

Always make sure the name server is run by a reputable company, and try to use the name servers provided by your ISP outside of troubleshooting scenarios

Registrar
- An org responsible for assigning individual domain names to other org or invididuals

The original way that numbered network addresses were correlated with words was through hosts files

Host files
- a flat file that contains, on each line, a network address followed by the host name it can be referred to as 
- e.g. 1.2.3.4 webserver
- evaluated by the networking stack of the operating system itself

Loopback address
- a way of sending network traffic to yourself
- IPv4 127.0.0.1

Alsmost every hosts file in existence will, in the very least, contain a line that reads 127.0.0.1 localhost, most likely followed by ::1 localhost, where ::1 is the loopback address for IPv6.

Host files are a popular way for computer viruses to disrupt and redirect users' traffic

Cloud Computing
- a technological approach where computing resources are provisioned in a shareable way, so that lots of users get what they need, when they need it
-> hardware virtualization

Virtualization
- a single physical machine, called a host, could run many individual virtual instances, called guests

Hypervisor 
- a piece of software that runs and manages virtual machines, while also offering these guests a virtual operating platform that is indistinguishable from actual hardware

public cloud
- a large cluster of machines run by another company

private cloud
- used by a single large corporation and generally physically hosted on its own premises

Cloud Computing
- a new model in computing where large clusters of machines let us use the total resources available in a better way

X as a Service
Cloud is an example of IaaS
-> PaaS where P =platform -> a subset of cloud computing where a platform is provided for customers to run their services 
-> SaaS where S =service -> a way of licensing the use of software to others while keeping that software centrally hosted and managed
e.g. Gmail/Office 365

Cloud Storage system- Secure, Accessible, Available

IPv6 Addressing and Subnetting
- IPv4 - 32bit (4.2 billion options) - 4 octets of decimal nums
- IPv6 - 128bit (39-digital-long options i.e Undecillion) - 8 groups of 16bits each(each of those further made uo of 4 hex nums)
-> diff: number of bits reserved for an address

2001:0db8 -> reserverd for doc and edu
FF00:: -> multicast
FE80:: -> link-local unicast addresses -> allow for local network segment communications and are configured based upon a host's MAC address

two rules when it comes to shortening an IPv6 address
1. you can remove any leading 0s from a group
2. any number of consecutive groups composed of just 0s can be replaced with ::

IPv6 -> (64)= Network ID + (64) = Host ID

IPv6 Header = (4) Version + (8) Class + (20) Flow Label + (16) Payload Length + Next Header(**)

IPv6 four times as long as IPv4

IPv4 mapped address space

Any IPv6 address that begins with 80 zeros, and is followed by 16 ones is understood to be part of the IPv4 address space, and the same is the same as IPv4

IPv6 tunnels
- servers take incoming IPv6 traffic and encapsulate it within traditional IPv4 datagram

IPv6 tunnel broker
- companies that provide IPv6 tunneling endpoints for you, so you don't have to introduce additional equipment to your network
