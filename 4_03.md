Software service
- service that employees use that allow them to do their daily job functions
-> Communication services
1. Instant Messaging
 e.g.Internet Channel Relay(IRC)
 e.g. Paid of options (HipChat/Slack)
 e.g. Open IM protocol(XMPP)-> Pidgin/Padium
2. Email Config
 e.g.run own managed server = setup email service software on server -> create a DNS record for your mail server 
 ==> A record is used for hostnames, but for email servers, we use MX for the mail exchange record
 e.g. Google Suite
 e.g. POP3 (downloads email from email server to local device and delete emails from server)
 -> good to maintain storage limitation
 -> privacy : emails can only been seen from local device
 e.g.IMAP (download emails from email server to mulitiple devices)->more popular nowadays
 e.g.SMTP (protocol for sending emails)

POP3 and IMAP for retreiving emails
SMTP for sending emails
 
-> Security services
-> User productivity services

Productivity services


Platform services
- provide a platform for developers to completely build and deploy software applications, without having to deal with OS maintenance, server hardware, networking or other services that are needed to use the platform tools.

HTTPS also referred to as HTTP over TLS or HTTP over SSL

2 protocols that enables us to make our web servers secure
1. Transport Layer Security protocol(TLS)
-> the most popular way to keep communication secure over a network
-> widely used to keep web browsing secure

2. Secure Sockey Layer protocol (SSL)
-> a way of securing communication between a web server and client
-> old and insecure comparing with TLS
=> SSL 3.0 === TLS 1.0

To use HTTPS, we need to get a digital cert of trust from cert authority
-> verifies that you are who you say you are

FAT32 -> compatible with Win/Linux/MacOs

Network File system (NFS)
- a protocol that enables files to be shared over a network
-> easiest way to setup via Linux env 
/share > physical harddisk

Samba >= NFS for Windows 
-> a software service suite used for file services which you can also read more about in the supplemental reading

SMB = a protocol that Sambe implements 

a relatively affordable solution for FAT storage hardware is to use NAS (Network-attached storage)
--> NASes are computers that are optimized for file storage

make sure business-critical data is synced in at least two places

Printers
Win - Print and Document Services
Linux - CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System)
=> manage printers from web URL
Cloud service provider -> manage printers via web browser

Localhost itself is reserved for this purpose -> not possible to get the domain name localhost
- we need to use DNS to let the world notice the existence of the web server

HTTP status codes (from HTTP response)
404 Not Found
4xx -> issue on the client-side
5xx -> issue on the server-side
2xx -> request successfully

SaaS (Software as a Service)
- the software is already pre-configured and the user isn't deeply involved in the cloud config
e.g. Microsoft Office 365

IaaS (Infra as a Service)
- hosting your own services in the cloud
- need to decide how you want the infra to look, depending on what you want ot run on it

Regions
- a geographical location containing a number of data centers
-> each of these data centers => a Zone (independent of each other)

Load Balancer
- ensures that each VM receives a balanced number of queries

Autoscaling
- allows the service to +/- capacity as needed 
-> (+) budget mgmt
