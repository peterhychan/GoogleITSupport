Internet
- the physical connection of computers and wires around the world

the Web
- the info on the Internet

Computers on a network have an identifier called an IP address

MAC addresses
- permanent and hard-coded onto the machine

When we send and/or receive data via network, we need both MAC addresses and IP

How we can connect networks:
1.	Ethernet
2.	Wifi
3. fiber optic cables

Router 
- Connection lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic

Network protocols: 
- a set of rules ensure: 
1. routed efficiently
2. are not corrupted
3. secure
4. right machine
5. named appropriately

IP 
- responsible for delivering our packets to the right computers

TCP
- delivers info from one network to another

URL = www. + domain name + .<domain ending>

DNS (Domain name system) -> let us use human-readable words to map to an IP address
