a basic physical layer made up of Cat5 or Cat6 and a data link layer made entirely of Ethernet

public switched telephone (PSTN) or Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS)

USENET
Dial-up connection
- uses POTS for data transfer

Transferring data across a dial-up -> via Modem/Demodulator -> turn digital signal into audible analog signal via telephone network 

Baud rate
- a measurement of how many bits can be passes across a phone line in a second

110 bps -> 300 bps -> 14.4 kbps

Broadband
- any connectivity technology that isn't dial-up internet

T-carrier tech
- originally invented by AT&T to transmit multiple phone calls over a single link

Transmission System 1 (T1) : max 24 phone calls across a single piece of twisted pair copper -> each of the 24 channel was capable of transmitting data at 64 kbps => a single T1 line 1.544 megabits per second

T3 line is 28 T1 all multiplexed achieving a total throughput speed of 44.736 megabits per second (1.555*28)

digital subscriber lines (DSL)
- allows data transfer and phone calls happen at the same time
- uses USLAMs (Digital subscriber line access multiplexer)
- usually long running
e.g. ADSL(Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)	-> features different speeds for outbound(UPLOAD) and incoming(DOWNLOAD) data 

e.g.  SDSL (Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
	-> almost the same as ADSL
	-> identical upload and download speed
	Upper Cap: the same as a T1 line

e.g. HDSL(High Bit-rate Digital Subscriber Lines)

Cable Communications Policy (1984)

coaxial cables

cable broadband
- shared bandwidth technology

CMTS(Cable modem termination system)
- connects lots of different cable connections to an ISPs core network

FTTX (Fiber To The X)
e.g. FTTB, FTTH, FTTP

Instead of modem, the demarcation point for fiber tech is known as Optical Network Terminator(ONT)

An ONT converts data from protocols the fiber network can understand to those that are more traditional twisted pair copper networks can understand.

Wide Area Network Tech (WAN)
- acts like a single network, but spans across
-  multiple physical locations
- works by using a number of different protocols at the data link layer to transport your data from one site to another
the ISP's actual core network is called a local loop
- good when you transport large amounts of data across lots of sites

Point-to-Point VPNs
- sets a VPN tunnel between 2 sites
- the tunneling logic is handled by network devices at either side so that users don't all have to establish their own connections

Wireless Networking Technologies
-> IEEE 802.11 standard -> WiFi (radiowaves)

Frequency band
- certain section of the radio spectrum that is been agreed upon to be used for certain communications 
e.g. US, FM radio transmissions b/t 88 and 108 MHz
e.g. Wifi at 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz
e.g. 802.11b just for testing, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac

802.11 = physical and data link layers

An 802.11 frame has a number of fields: 
1. frame control (2 octets) = 16 bits long-> how the frame should be processed
2. duration/ID (2 octets)-> how long the total frame is
3. Address field 1 (6 octets)
4. ...2 (6 octets)
5. ...3 (6 octets)
6. Sequence Control (2) - 16 bit long -> keep track of the ordering of frames
7. ...4 (6)
8. Data payload (0-7951)
9. FCS (4) = frame check sequence-> checksum for a cuclical redundancy check
wherea 3 to 8 => MAC Header

Wireless Access Point
- a device that bridges the wireless and wired portions of a network
- 4 access points as we need them to judge which wireless access point should be processing the frame

Wireless Network Configuration
- Ad-hoc networks = nodes all speak directly to each other
	-> no supporting network infra
- wireless LANs (WLANS)= >=1 access point(s) act as a bridge b/t a wireless and a wired network
	 -> most common: consists of >=1 access point(s) which act as bridges b/w the wireless and wired(as normal LAN consists of outbound internet link) networks
- Mesh networks = a hybrid of the two
	-> made up of only wireless access points
	-> will still be connected to a wired network
	
Channels 
- individuals, smaller sections of the overall frequency band used by a wireless network
-> help addressing collision domains

Wireless Security
- WEP(Wired Equivalent Privacy)
	-> an encryption tech that provides a very low level of privacy
	-> only uses 40 bits for its encryption keys and with the speed of modern computers
- WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
	-> uses a 128-bit key
	-> making it more difficult to crack than WEP
	i.e. the most commonly used encrption algo for wireless network is WPA2
		-> uses 256-bits
	another common way to help secure wireless networks is through MAC filtering
	-> you configure your access points to only allow for connections from a specfic set of MAC addresses belonging to devices you trust

Cellular Networking
- at a high level, it has a lot in common with the 802.11 networks we've already talked about
- operates over radio waves
- built around the concept of cells

Mobile Device Networks:
1. Cellular networks
2. WiFi
3. Bluetooth
4. IoT network protocols
