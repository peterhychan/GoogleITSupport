Hardware of computers

Ports
- connection points taht we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer

CPU
- the brain of our computer, it does all calculations and data processing

RAM (Random Access Memory)
- short-term memory of computers
- store data that we want to access quickly
e.g. DDR4 (fastest option in the marketplace now)

Hard drive
- hold all of our data
- HDD (the one with higher RPM, the faster it is)
- SSD -> faster than HDD, but more expensive

Motherboard
- holds and connects all pieces of computer components together
- chipset (northbridge, southbridge) --> allows us to manage data between CPU, RAM and Peripherals (i.e. external device connect the computer)
- expansion slots --> offers ability to increase functionality of computers
- form factors 

External Data Bus (EDB)
- a row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer
- used to transport binary data 

Address Bus 
- used to transport memory addresses.

Memory Control Chip(MCC)
- the bridge between teh CPU and the RAM

Cache <= RAM
- used to store recently or frequently accessed data
- L1(smallest and fastest), L2 an L3(largest and slowest).
-> Clock wire (a ticking of a clock) 
-> Each cycle of calculations = clock cycles

Clock speed
- the maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle in a certain time period
e.g. 3.40 Ghz is 3.4 billion cycles per second


When the CPU does the computation, it stores info in registers first.

2 types of CPU sockets
- LGA
- PGA

1 bit -> 8 bits = 1 byte -> 1024 bytes = 1 KB and so on

DC (direct current) : one direction

AC (alternating current): two directions

pressure of electicity = voltage 

Amperage (amps) = the amount of electricity coming out -> will pull as much electric as needed

Wattage = the amount of volts and amps that a device needs 

System on a chip (SoC)
- packs the CPU, RAM and sometimes even the storage onto a single chip
- generally consumes less electric than separate motherboards + components

MB is megabyte or unit of data storage

Mb/s is megabit per second, which is a unit of data transfer rate


--> 1 byte is 8 bits ==> transfer a 1MB file in a second requires a 8Mb/s connection speed

e.g. USB 2.0 has a bandwidth of 480 Mb/s, which is roughly 60 MB/s. It would take around 17 seconds to transfer 1024 MB of data.


BIOS (basic input output services)
- the software that helps initialize the hardware in our computer and gets the OS up and running
- POST
-> stored in ROM (read-only-chip) chips
- it runs every single time when we turn on the computer
- stored at CMOS chip

UEFI
- similar with BIOS but it's more modern and with better compatitbility and support for new hardwares
