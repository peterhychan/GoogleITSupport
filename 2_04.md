DNS (Domain Name System): string(domain name) -> IP address 
- application layer service uses UDP instead of TCP for the transport layer

Domain name 
- the term we use for sth that can be resolved by DNS

Name resolution

DNS servers are one of the things that need to be specifically configured at a node on a network

IP adddress, subnet mask, gateway for a host, DNS server must be specifically configured

5 types of DNS servers:
1. Caching name server (provided by ISP)
2. Recursing name server (provided by ISP)
	-> perform full DNS resolution requests
--> 1+2 => store known domain name lookups for a certain amount of time
3. Root name server
4. TLD name server
5. Authoritative name server

ALL domain names in the global DNS system have a TTL
TTL 
- a value, in seconds, that can be configured by the owner of a domain name for how long a name server is allowed to cache an entry before it should discard it and perform a full resolution again

contact a root named servers (13 in total) -> directs queries towards the appropriate TLD(top-level domain) name server
TLD is the last part of any domain name e.g. .com/.edu/.gov/.io

Anycast
- a technique that is used to route traffic to different destinations depending on factors like location, congestion, or link health

A single DNS request and its response can usually fit inside of a single UDP datagram
- DNS generates a lot of traffic both on local machines and caching name servers

44 packets TCP
8 packets UDP

Resource Reord Types (DNS):
1. A record -> used to point a certain domain name at a certain IPv4 IP address
-> a single A record is configured for a single domain name
-> a single A domain name can have many A records
=> DNS Round robin => used to balance traffic across many IPs (by one-by-one approach)
2. AAAA (Quad A)-> become more popular -> returns a IPv6 address
3. CNAME(canonical) record -> used to redirect traffic from one domain name to another -> can only change A-record at one place -> one source of truth
4. MX record (mail exchange) -> ensure emails gets delivered to a company's mail server
5. SRV record(service record)-> similar to MX record, used to define the location of various specific servicess, EXCEPT SRV can be used for many service types
6. TXT record (text) - has a field of free-form -> used for configuration preferences about network services that you have entrusted

Domain name = SubDomain + Domains+ TLD(managed by ICANN) => FQDN
FQDN = Fully qualified domain name

Domains-> used to demarcate where control moves from a TLD name server to an authoritative name server

DNS can support 127 levels of domain in total for a single fully qualified domain name,
Each individual section can only be 63 CHARs long
Complete FQDN is limited to a total of 255 CHARs

DNS Zones
- a hierarchical concept
- zones don't overlap
- allow for easier control over multiple levels of a domain
-> configured via Zone file = simple config files  (SOA) that declare all resource records for a particular zone

Start of Authority(SOA)
- declares the zone and the name of the name server that is authoritative for it

NS records 
- indicate other name servers that might also be responsible for this zone

Reverse lookup zone files
- these let DNS resolvers ask for an IP and get the FQDN associated with it returned

Dynamic Host Config Protocol (DHCP)
- an application layer protocol that automates the config process of hosts on a network
- relies on the transport, data link and physical layers to operate

Dynamic allocation
- a range of IP addresses is set aside for client devices and one of these IPs is issued to these devices when they request one

Fixed allocation
- requires a manually specified list of MAC address and their corresponding IPs

**FOUR-> Subnet mask + Gateway + Name(DNS) server are likely the same on just about every node on the network 

IP address needs to be different on every single node on the network

NTP(Network Time protocol) Servers
- used to keep all computers on a network synchronized in time

DHCP Discovery
- the process by which a client configured to use DHCP attempts to get network configuation info
- 4 steps:
1. server discovery step (client sends DHCP discover message out onto the network) -> always sent from UDP source port 68 (destination port of 67) DHCPDISCOVER
2. DHCP server examines its own config and would make the decision on what IP address to offer to the client DHCPOFFER
3. DHCPREQUEST 68->67
4. DHCPREQUEST with a DHCPACK/DHCP ACK 
=> DHCP lease as it includes an expiration time

NAT (Network Address Translation)
- a technique instead of a defined standard
- different OSs implement NAT differently
-> security safeguard + preserving the limited amounts of available IPv4 space
- a technology that allows a gateway, usually a router or firewall, to rewrite the source IP of an outgoing IP datagram while retaining the original IP in order to rewrite it into the response
-> IP masquerading (hiding the IP to the receiver)

the entire space of network X is protected and invisible -> One-to-many NAT
-> their outbound traffic translated into NAT to a single IP

Port preservation
- a technique where the source port chosen by a client is the same port used by the router

Port forwarding
- a technique where specific destination ports can be config to always be delivered to spec nodes

4.2 billions IPv4 addresses

RIRs (Regional internet registries)
- Afrinic
- Arin
- Apnic
- Lacnic
- Ripe
-> responsible for assigning IP Address blocks to orgs within their geographic areas and most have aleady run out

ran out of IPv4
- NAT
- non-routable address space

Virtual Private Networks(VPN)
- a tech that allows for the extension of a private or local network to hosts that might not be on that local network
- a tunneling protocol
- establish site-to-site connectivity
- not a strictly defined protocol

two-factor authentication
- a tech where more that just a username + password are required to authenciate

Proxy service
- a server that acts on behalf of a client in order to access another service
1. anonymity
2. security 
3. content filtering
4. increased performance
e.g. gateway routers
- exists at almost every layer of networking model
e.g. web proxy
e.g. reverse proxy
- a service that might appear to be a single server to external clients, but actually represents many servers living behind it
